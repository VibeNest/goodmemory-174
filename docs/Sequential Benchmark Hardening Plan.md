# Sequential Benchmark Hardening Plan

This file is the compact route for external benchmark hardening. Historical per-run notes were removed from this current-truth surface; use git history, `reports/eval/`, and `reports/quality-gates/` for provenance.

## Sequence

1. LongMemEval
2. BEAM
3. MemoryAgentBench
4. LoCoMo

Do not publish a benchmark claim until the relevant phase has live answer generation, live or accepted judging where required, current evidence links, and an accepted gate. Internal recall diagnostics are engineering evidence, not public leaderboard claims.

## Current State

- Phase 62 LongMemEval is accepted as the first external-benchmark hardening slice.
- Phase 63 BEAM is active and still partial.
- Current BEAM work is scoped to provider-free recall diagnostics plus small live answer-generation/judge slices before any public score.

## Accepted Phase 62 Checkpoint

- Run: `run-phase62-longmemeval-full500-current-after-remaining-personal-hybrid-retry-r1-merged-20260517T161058Z`
- Profile: `goodmemory-hybrid`
- Result: 454/500 answer accuracy, evidence-session recall 0.9590, missed recall 35, wrong recall 6, wrong answers 46, `executionFailures: 0`.
- Boundary: accepted internal LongMemEval close evidence, not a README-level public benchmark claim.

## Active Phase 63 Evidence

- Smoke harness: `run-phase63-beam-smoke-current` plus gate `run-20260518003000`.
- Real 100K adapter proof: `run-phase63-beam-100k-full-initial-20260518T000335Z` over `/private/tmp/BEAM/100K.json`, 20 rows and 400 probing questions. This proves ingestion/contract shape only because it uses deterministic oracle evidence.
- First real rules-only recall diagnostic: `run-phase63-beam-100k-recall-diagnostic-rules-full-20260518T005500Z`, evidence-chat recall 0.11625896794910878, missed 340/355, wrong-recall/noise 362/400, `executionFailures: 0`.
- Best small live slice: `run-phase63-beam-100k-live-slice-rules-context-ordered-pruning-v6-initial3-escalated-20260518T160743`, answer accuracy 3/3, evidence-chat recall 1.0, wrong-recall/noise 2/3, `executionFailures: 0`.
- Latest accepted retained diagnostic: `run-phase63-beam-100k-recall-diagnostic-rules-personal-finance-planning-summary-v2-current-20260611T093000Z`. Compared with `run-phase63-beam-100k-recall-diagnostic-rules-estate-planning-process-summary-current-20260611T000000Z`, it raises evidence-chat recall to 0.7504583053878827, missed-recall cases to 123/355, wrong-recall/noise to 267/400, zero-recall cases remain 42, and global hit/missing/noise ids from 782/312/1460 to 786/308/1447. Target `16:summarization:2` now returns chats 31/83/87/193/231, recovering personal finance planning milestones for rent reduction, Excel investment tracking, Yahoo Finance API refresh, dining-out budget control, and the December 1 holiday grocery-budget adjustment while removing noisy chats 20/21/28/29/36/37/172/173/230/270/271/288/289.

## Current Open Boundary

Phase 63 remains recall-limited and noisy. The next loop should stay narrow:

1. Pick one named miss/noise family from the latest analyzer.
2. Add a focused failing regression.
3. Make a scoped selector or routing repair.
4. Rerun focused tests, the retained diagnostic, and analyzer comparison.
5. Update only this summary, the Phase 63 task file, and generated evidence pointers when the retained delta is accepted.

Do not treat a focused green or one recovered row as BEAM closure.
