# Sequential Benchmark Hardening Plan

This file is the compact route for external benchmark hardening. Historical per-run notes were removed from this current-truth surface; use git history, `reports/eval/`, and `reports/quality-gates/` for provenance.

## Sequence

1. LongMemEval
2. BEAM
3. MemoryAgentBench
4. LoCoMo

Do not publish a benchmark claim until the relevant phase has live answer generation, live or accepted judging where required, current evidence links, and an accepted gate. Internal recall diagnostics are engineering evidence, not public leaderboard claims.

## Current State

- Phase 62 LongMemEval is accepted as the first external-benchmark hardening slice.
- Phase 63 BEAM is active and still partial.
- Current BEAM work is scoped to provider-free recall diagnostics plus small live answer-generation/judge slices before any public score.

## Accepted Phase 62 Checkpoint

- Run: `run-phase62-longmemeval-full500-current-after-remaining-personal-hybrid-retry-r1-merged-20260517T161058Z`
- Profile: `goodmemory-hybrid`
- Result: 454/500 answer accuracy, evidence-session recall 0.9590, missed recall 35, wrong recall 6, wrong answers 46, `executionFailures: 0`.
- Boundary: accepted internal LongMemEval close evidence, not a README-level public benchmark claim.

## Active Phase 63 Evidence

- Smoke harness: `run-phase63-beam-smoke-current` plus gate `run-20260518003000`.
- Real 100K adapter proof: `run-phase63-beam-100k-full-initial-20260518T000335Z` over `/private/tmp/BEAM/100K.json`, 20 rows and 400 probing questions. This proves ingestion/contract shape only because it uses deterministic oracle evidence.
- First real rules-only recall diagnostic: `run-phase63-beam-100k-recall-diagnostic-rules-full-20260518T005500Z`, evidence-chat recall 0.11625896794910878, missed 340/355, wrong-recall/noise 362/400, `executionFailures: 0`.
- Best small live slice: `run-phase63-beam-100k-live-slice-rules-context-ordered-pruning-v6-initial3-escalated-20260518T160743`, answer accuracy 3/3, evidence-chat recall 1.0, wrong-recall/noise 2/3, `executionFailures: 0`.
- Latest accepted retained diagnostic: `run-phase63-beam-100k-recall-diagnostic-rules-sneaker-choice-recall-current-20260612T192900Z`. Compared with `run-phase63-beam-100k-recall-diagnostic-rules-movie-list-game-night-days-current-20260612T191900Z`, it raises evidence-chat recall to 0.8454504806617482, lowers missed-recall cases to 88/355, wrong-recall/noise to 231/400, and zero-recall to 11, and moves global hit/missing/noise ids from 897/197/1243 to 898/196/1235. Target `15:information_extraction:2` goes from zero recall to full recall, returning the single designated turn 1 while removing all eight noisy chats 27/66/67/83/146/147/159/195, with zero new noise and exactly one case delta. Caveat recorded in the evidence predicate: the benchmark designates the assistant sneaker-recommendations opener as the evidence for the chosen-option question while the user's actual Adidas-over-Nike choice statement lives in later turns, so live answer slices should expect the choice answer to come from those confusable turns instead of the designated evidence.

## Current Open Boundary

Phase 63 remains recall-limited and noisy. The next loop should stay narrow:

1. Pick one named miss/noise family from the latest analyzer.
2. Add a focused failing regression.
3. Make a scoped selector or routing repair.
4. Rerun focused tests, the retained diagnostic, and analyzer comparison.
5. Update only this summary, the Phase 63 task file, and generated evidence pointers when the retained delta is accepted.

Do not treat a focused green or one recovered row as BEAM closure.
