# GoodMemory Current Status and Evidence

This document is the stable entrypoint for the current repo state.
It summarizes what is public, what remains internal, and which evidence artifacts are the canonical places to audit today.
It intentionally replaces phase-by-phase navigation at the top level of `README.md` and `docs/`.

## Stable OSS Surface

- Public memory API remains centered on `createGoodMemory`, `remember`, `recall`, `buildContext`, `feedback`, `forget`, `exportMemory`, and `deleteAllMemory`.
- Public domain write customization is now accepted through `GoodMemoryConfig.remember`, `RememberProfile`, `rememberRules`, `RememberInput.annotations`, and traceable extractor composition.
- `goodmemory`, `goodmemory/ai-sdk`, and `goodmemory/host` now resolve through compiled `dist/` artifacts and emitted type declarations on the packaged install surface.
- `createGoodMemory({})` now defaults to auto storage resolution: explicit storage config wins as one source; otherwise Postgres is preferred only when a configured target can bootstrap the GoodMemory backend; Bun keeps local SQLite as the zero-config durable fallback; Node zero-config runtime falls back to in-memory when the built-in local SQLite adapter is unavailable.
- `inspectGoodMemoryRuntime(memory)` now exposes the sanitized resolved storage/runtime plan so Node zero-config in-memory fallback is observable through the public API instead of being silent, unsupported built-in `sqlite` / `postgres` selections are reported as unavailable instead of durable, and injected storage adapters are reported as adapter-defined execution instead of being mislabeled as the configured built-in plan.
- The official CLI surface remains memory-first for stable read paths: `goodmemory inspect`, `trace`, `export-memory`, `stats`, plus nested eval inspection commands, and the installed-package invocation path is `./node_modules/.bin/goodmemory ...`. The package bin is Node-safe, `goodmemory -V` / `goodmemory --version` answer directly from package metadata, and non-version command execution is still Bun-backed today.
- Phase 35 installed host-memory middleware is now part of the accepted stable host surface through `goodmemory install|uninstall <codex|claude>`, `goodmemory enable|disable <codex|claude>`, `SessionStart` / `UserPromptSubmit` hooks, read-only MCP, and explicit write CLI commands. The install flow now supports optional Postgres, embedding, and LLM extraction provider flags while still allowing users to skip them and add them later in `~/.goodmemory/<host>.json`.
- Phase 35 is now closed as the installed host-memory middleware and hooks slice.
- Installed-package external host wiring remains available through `goodmemory codex bootstrap` and `goodmemory claude bootstrap` as lower-level compatibility scaffolding for artifact-first integrations.
- Host integration stays on the explicit adapter/package path; hook-injected recall is the canonical always-on middleware path for enabled repositories, while MCP is a deep-read/debug surface rather than the default recall transport.
- `goodmemory/host` now includes an explicit pre-action contract through `HostActionIntent`, `HostActionAssessmentResult`, `HostActionDecision`, `HostAdapter.assessAction()`, and `resolveHostActionExecutionPlan()`.
- Optional adapter-level agent-event ingestion now exists on `goodmemory/ai-sdk` and `goodmemory/host`; no new root `goodmemory/evolution` module was added.
- root `goodmemory` no longer re-exports internal evolution contracts; proposal, reviewer, compiler, and maintenance internals stay outside the stable root API.
- adapter/event `user_correction` is proposal-first and records selective evidence plus promotion receipts instead of writing an intermediate active feedback memory.
- `sqlite` remains the stable default local durable document/session/vector backend on Bun.
- Generic live-memory eval semantics are now auto-storage aligned across both CLI and script helpers:
  - `bun run eval:live-memory` and `runLiveMemoryEval()` follow the normal runtime storage resolver, so default local SQLite remains valid and configured Postgres becomes provider-backed.
  - `bun run eval:live-provider-memory` and `runLiveProviderMemoryEval()` are the explicit provider-backed entrypoints when silent fallback would invalidate evidence.
- Historical phase-specific provider-backed evidence still lives under `reports/eval/live-memory/phase-*`; those paths come from dedicated phase runners and should not be confused with the current generic `eval:live-memory` CLI contract.
- `GOODMEMORY_EMBEDDING_*` now controls automatic embedding enablement; when those variables are absent, runtime behavior stays `rules-only`.
- Local SQLite runtime guardrails are available through `GOODMEMORY_SQLITE_CUSTOM_LIBRARY_PATH`, `GOODMEMORY_SQLITE_VECTOR_EXTENSION_PATH`, and `GOODMEMORY_SQLITE_VECTOR_MODE=off|prefer|require`.
- Supported local runtimes can now auto-upgrade the SQLite semantic path to a real `sqlite-vss` indexed backend; unsupported runtimes stay on the accepted durable fallback path and must not claim acceleration.
- Retrieval rollout controls, promotion gates, salvage hooks, and internal provider-router rollout controls remain implementation detail, not README-level product surface.
- Implicit behavioral adaptation eval is internal evidence infrastructure; it does not change the stable OSS runtime surface.
- Behavioral adaptation outcome telemetry and deterministic Layer D evidence are also internal evidence infrastructure; they do not change the stable OSS runtime surface.
- Trace-backed behavioral enactment over the accepted Codex host path is internal evidence infrastructure; it does not widen the public `GoodMemory` API, public config, or README-level default behavior.

## Latest Closed Slice

- Phase 36 is now closed as the public domain write profiles and rules slice.
- Accepted behavior:
  - `createGoodMemory({ remember: ... })` is public API for domain-specific write profiles
  - `rememberRules` supports regex, predicate, and direct mapper rules that produce normal candidates
  - profile custom extractors compose with deterministic and assisted extraction instead of replacing normalization, classification, policy, evidence, conflict handling, vector writes, or rollback
  - profile custom extractors can use named `{ id, extractor }` entries so remember traces and eval reports keep stable `extractorIds`; blank, duplicate, or generated raw-namespace ids fail during profile resolution
  - `RememberInput.annotations` supports host write intent, metadata patches, kind hints, confirmation, verification, and reasons
  - assistant-originated durable writes remain ignored by default and require both host annotation and an allowing profile policy
  - `remember: "never"` masks annotated message content before deterministic, custom, or assisted extraction
  - domain metadata persists on preferences, facts, references, and feedback, and Markdown exports render the metadata needed for auditability
  - remember events trace profile, preset, extractor, rule, annotation, and extraction strategy influence
  - default preset, rules, custom extractor, assisted-only, and annotation-derived candidates all carry resolved profile/preset trace metadata
  - the life-coach/OneLife-style scenario is documented as a generic public configuration pattern, not a built-in preset
- Still outside the accepted Phase 36 claim:
  - making OneLife a built-in preset
  - requiring assisted extraction, provider-backed storage, or a database service for zero-config users
  - automatic assistant-answer memory without host confirmation or verification
  - reopening recall routing or retrieval profile promotion

## How To Navigate

- Use `README.md`, `docs/GoodMemory-PRD.md`, and the architecture docs when you need the product story or public integration shape.
- Use `task-board/00-README.txt` when you need execution order, closed/open slices, or explicit reopen rules for future work.
- Use `docs/archive/quality-gates/README.md` when you need historical closure detail for a specific capability slice.
- Use `reports/quality-gates/` and `reports/eval/` when you need raw evidence rather than a summarized judgment.

## Scope Boundary

- Top-level docs should stay product-oriented and current-state-oriented.
- Phase history is preserved, but it now lives in the archive layer instead of the main documentation surface.
