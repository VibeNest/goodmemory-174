# GoodMemory Current Status and Evidence

This document is the stable entrypoint for the current repo state.
It summarizes what is public, what remains internal, and which evidence artifacts are the canonical places to audit today.
It intentionally replaces phase-by-phase navigation at the top level of `README.md` and `docs/`.

## Stable OSS Surface

- Public memory API remains centered on `createGoodMemory`, `remember`, `recall`, `buildContext`, `feedback`, `forget`, `exportMemory`, and `deleteAllMemory`.
- The official CLI surface remains memory-first: `goodmemory inspect`, `trace`, `export-memory`, `stats`, plus nested eval inspection commands.
- Host integration stays on the explicit adapter path; `file-assisted` remains the recommended default mode for Claude/Codex-style consumption.
- `sqlite` is stable today as the local durable document/session backend; it does not yet auto-provide a local vector backend for hybrid recall.
- Retrieval rollout controls, promotion gates, salvage hooks, and internal provider-router rollout controls remain implementation detail, not README-level product surface.
- Implicit behavioral adaptation eval is internal evidence infrastructure; it does not change the stable OSS runtime surface.
- Behavioral adaptation outcome telemetry and deterministic Layer D evidence are also internal evidence infrastructure; they do not change the stable OSS runtime surface.

  - Deterministic fallback report: `reports/eval/fallback/phase-25/run-1776673441250/report.json`
  - Live-memory behavioral closure is not yet a canonical accepted artifact for this slice.
- Historical v1 snapshot:
  - `docs/GoodMemory-v1-Quality-Gate.md`

## How To Navigate

- Use `README.md`, `docs/GoodMemory-PRD.md`, and the architecture docs when you need the product story or public integration shape.
- Use `task-board/00-README.txt` when you need execution order, closed/open slices, or explicit reopen rules for future work.
- Use `docs/archive/quality-gates/README.md` when you need historical closure detail for a specific capability slice.
- Use `reports/quality-gates/` and `reports/eval/` when you need raw evidence rather than a summarized judgment.

## Scope Boundary

- Top-level docs should stay product-oriented and current-state-oriented.
- Phase history is preserved, but it now lives in the archive layer instead of the main documentation surface.
